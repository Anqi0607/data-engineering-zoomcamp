## Module 4 Homework

For this homework, you will need the following datasets:
* [Green Taxi dataset (2019 and 2020)](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/tag/green)
* [Yellow Taxi dataset (2019 and 2020)](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/tag/yellow)
* [For Hire Vehicle dataset (2019)](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/tag/fhv)

### Question 1: Understanding dbt model resolution

Provided you've got the following sources.yaml
```yaml
version: 2

sources:
  - name: raw_nyc_tripdata
    database: "{{ env_var('DBT_BIGQUERY_PROJECT', 'dtc_zoomcamp_2025') }}"
    schema:   "{{ env_var('DBT_BIGQUERY_SOURCE_DATASET', 'raw_nyc_tripdata') }}"
    tables:
      - name: ext_green_taxi
      - name: ext_yellow_taxi
```

with the following env variables setup where `dbt` runs:
```shell
export DBT_BIGQUERY_PROJECT=myproject
export DBT_BIGQUERY_DATASET=my_nyc_tripdata
```

What does this .sql model compile to?
```sql
select * 
from {{ source('raw_nyc_tripdata', 'ext_green_taxi' ) }}
```

**Answer:** 
- `select * from myproject.raw_nyc_tripdata.ext_green_taxi`

`export DBT_BIGQUERY_PROJECT=myproject` specified the value of database name to be `myproject`, instead of the default value of `dtc_zoomcamp_2025`.

`DBT_BIGQUERY_SOURCE_DATASET` isn't specified, so the default value of `raw_nyc_tripdata` will be used in the compiled query.



### Question 2: dbt Variables & Dynamic Models

Say you have to modify the following dbt_model (`fct_recent_taxi_trips.sql`) to enable Analytics Engineers to dynamically control the date range. 

- In development, you want to process only **the last 7 days of trips**
- In production, you need to process **the last 30 days** for analytics

```sql
select *
from {{ ref('fact_taxi_trips') }}
where pickup_datetime >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30' DAY
```

What would you change to accomplish that in a such way that command line arguments takes precedence over ENV_VARs, which takes precedence over DEFAULT value?

**Answer:**
- Update the WHERE clause to `pickup_datetime >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '{{ var("days_back", env_var("DAYS_BACK", "30")) }}' DAY`

var() refers to the command line arguments, e.g. `dbt run --vars '{"days_back": 7}'`

env_var() refers to the environment variable, e.g. `export DAYS_BACK=7`

`30` is the default value if neither of the above two variables are provided.


### Question 3: dbt Data Lineage and Execution

Considering the data lineage below **and** that taxi_zone_lookup is the **only** materialization build (from a .csv seed file):

![image](./homework_q2.png)

Select the option that does **NOT** apply for materializing `fct_taxi_monthly_zone_revenue`:

- `dbt run`
- `dbt run --select +models/core/dim_taxi_trips.sql+ --target prod`
- `dbt run --select +models/core/fct_taxi_monthly_zone_revenue.sql`
- `dbt run --select +models/core/`
- `dbt run --select models/staging/+`

Answer:

Looks like every option will materialize fct_taxi_monthly_zone_revenue? Need to check the official solution once provided.



### Question 4: dbt Macros and Jinja

Consider you're dealing with sensitive data (e.g.: [PII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data)), that is **only available to your team and very selected few individuals**, in the `raw layer` of your DWH (e.g: a specific BigQuery dataset or PostgreSQL schema), 

 - Among other things, you decide to obfuscate/masquerade that data through your staging models, and make it available in a different schema (a `staging layer`) for other Data/Analytics Engineers to explore

- And **optionally**, yet  another layer (`service layer`), where you'll build your dimension (`dim_`) and fact (`fct_`) tables (assuming the [Star Schema dimensional modeling](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/star-schema)) for Dashboarding and for Tech Product Owners/Managers

You decide to make a macro to wrap a logic around it:

```sql
{% macro resolve_schema_for(model_type) -%}

    {%- set target_env_var = 'DBT_BIGQUERY_TARGET_DATASET'  -%}
    {%- set stging_env_var = 'DBT_BIGQUERY_STAGING_DATASET' -%}

    {%- if model_type == 'core' -%} {{- env_var(target_env_var) -}}

    {# This means: if stging_env_var is not defined, use target_env_var as default #}
    {%- else -%}                    {{- env_var(stging_env_var, env_var(target_env_var)) -}}

    {%- endif -%}

{%- endmacro %}
```

And use on your staging, dim_ and fact_ models as:
```sql
{{ config(
    schema=resolve_schema_for('core'), 
) }}
```

That all being said, regarding macro above, **select all statements that are true to the models using it**:
- Setting a value for  `DBT_BIGQUERY_TARGET_DATASET` env var is mandatory, or it'll fail to compile **True**
- Setting a value for `DBT_BIGQUERY_STAGING_DATASET` env var is mandatory, or it'll fail to compile **False**
- When using `core`, it materializes in the dataset defined in `DBT_BIGQUERY_TARGET_DATASET` **True**
- When using `stg`, it materializes in the dataset defined in `DBT_BIGQUERY_STAGING_DATASET`, or defaults to `DBT_BIGQUERY_TARGET_DATASET` **True**
- When using `staging`, it materializes in the dataset defined in `DBT_BIGQUERY_STAGING_DATASET`, or defaults to `DBT_BIGQUERY_TARGET_DATASET`**True**


### Question 5: Taxi Quarterly Revenue Growth

1. Create a new model `fct_taxi_trips_quarterly_revenue.sql`
2. Compute the Quarterly Revenues for each year for based on `total_amount`
3. Compute the Quarterly YoY (Year-over-Year) revenue growth 
  * e.g.: In 2020/Q1, Green Taxi had -12.34% revenue growth compared to 2019/Q1
  * e.g.: In 2020/Q4, Yellow Taxi had +34.56% revenue growth compared to 2019/Q4

Considering the YoY Growth in 2020, which were the yearly quarters with the best (or less worse) and worst results for green, and yellow

Answer:

for sql script, see `fct_taxi_trips_quarterly_revenue.sql` file

- `green: {best: 2020/Q1, worst: 2020/Q2}, yellow: {best: 2020/Q1, worst: 2020/Q2}`


### Question 6: P97/P95/P90 Taxi Monthly Fare

1. Create a new model `fct_taxi_trips_monthly_fare_p95.sql`
2. Filter out invalid entries (`fare_amount > 0`, `trip_distance > 0`, and `payment_type_description in ('Cash', 'Credit Card')`)
3. Compute the **continous percentile** of `fare_amount` partitioning by service_type, year and and month

Now, what are the values of `p97`, `p95`, `p90` for Green Taxi and Yellow Taxi, in April 2020?

Answer:

- `green: {p97: 55.0, p95: 45.0, p90: 26.5}, yellow: {p97: 31.5, p95: 25.5, p90: 19.0}`

use `approx_quantiles(fare_amount, 100)[offset(97)]` and `group by service type, year, month` to calculate **continous percentile**

for sql script, see `fct_taxi_trips_monthly_fare_p95` file
